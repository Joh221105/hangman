# hangman

## Description

I built the classic game of Hangman a few years ago, and it is currently played in the command terminal. I am planning on updating it with a few new features.

## What I Learned

- How to request data from a website to fetch a list of words.
- Implementing conditional looping to handle game logic and player interactions.

## Planned Features

What I would like to do is add some features such as:

- Creating a UI for the game instead of having it in the command line.
- Allowing players to choose the difficulty of their game, which will affect how many lives they get.
- Giving players the option to choose if they want a short, medium, or long word.
- Giving players the option to guess the word outright
- Displaying the number of letters prior to the first guess

## Future Learning Goals

I plan on learning how to use libraries such as:

- Tkinter to make the GUI and enhance user experience.
- Other libraries to further improve the functionality and aesthetics of the game.


Enjoy playing Hangman and stay tuned for updates!
